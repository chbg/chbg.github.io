## Keyword research selection metrics

Several SEO metrics can be used to build a strong keyword research foundation for a website. These metrics include:

### Search volume
Search volume is an important SEO metric to use when building a strong keyword research foundation for a website because it measures the number of times a particular keyword or phrase is searched for on a search engine. This metric can help identify the most relevant and popular terms among your target audience, which is essential for creating content that will attract and engage visitors.

By identifying keywords with high search volume, you can prioritize the terms that are most likely to drive traffic to your website. This is especially important for businesses that rely on search engine traffic to generate leads and sales. By targeting the right keywords, you can attract more qualified visitors to your website who are more likely to convert into customers.

In addition, search volume can also help you identify opportunities to create content around popular and relevant topics that may not be directly related to your business but could still attract a large audience. This can help you diversify your traffic sources and reach a wider audience, leading to more leads and sales.
