## Keyword research selection metrics

Several SEO metrics can be used to build a strong keyword research foundation for a website. These metrics include:

### Search volume
Search volume is an important SEO metric to use when building a strong keyword research foundation for a website because it measures the number of times a particular keyword or phrase is searched for on a search engine. This metric can help identify the most relevant and popular terms among your target audience, which is essential for creating content that will attract and engage visitors.

By identifying keywords with high search volume, you can prioritize the terms that are most likely to drive traffic to your website. This is especially important for businesses that rely on search engine traffic to generate leads and sales. By targeting the right keywords, you can attract more qualified visitors to your website who are more likely to convert into customers.

In addition, search volume can also help you identify opportunities to create content around popular and relevant topics that may not be directly related to your business but could still attract a large audience. This can help you diversify your traffic sources and reach a wider audience, leading to more leads and sales.

#### The pros and cons of using search volume to identify target keywords

| Pros     | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Search volume is a good indicator of the popularity of a keyword. | It can be difficult to accurately estimate search volume, as it can vary based on factors such as location and the specific search engine being used. |
| High search volume keywords can potentially drive more traffic to a website. | Targeting high search volume keywords can be competitive and may require more resources to rank well. |
| Search volume can help prioritize which keywords to target first. | Search volume alone may not be a sufficient indicator of the value of a keyword. Other factors such as relevance, conversion rate, and competition should also be considered. |
| Tracking changes in search volume can provide insights into the performance of an SEO campaign. | Some keywords with low search volume may still be valuable to target, especially if they are relevant to a business's products or services and have a high conversion rate. | 

### Keyword difficulty

Keyword difficulty is an important SEO metric to use when building a strong keyword research foundation for a website because it helps identify the level of competition for a particular keyword. By understanding the level of competition for a keyword, you can better understand the likelihood of your website ranking for that keyword in search results.

For example, if you are trying to rank for a highly competitive keyword with a high difficulty score, achieving high rankings in search results may be more challenging. On the other hand, if you are targeting a keyword with a low difficulty score, you may have a better chance of ranking highly in search results.

In addition to helping you understand the level of competition for a particular keyword, keyword difficulty can also help you identify potential opportunities for your website. By targeting keywords with low difficulty scores, you may be able to rank for those keywords more easily and drive more targeted traffic to your website.

Furthermore, tracking keyword difficulty over time can also help you understand trends in search behavior and identify changes in the level of competition for certain keywords. By monitoring these trends, you can adjust your keyword research strategy accordingly and ensure that your website targets the right keywords at the right time.

#### The pros and cons of using keyword difficulty to identify target keywords

| Pros     | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Helps identify keywords that are more likely to rank well. | May not accurately reflect the actual difficulty of ranking for a keyword. |
| Allows you to prioritize your efforts and allocate resources effectively. | May not take into account the quality or relevance of the content being optimized. |
| Can save time and resources by avoiding keywords that are too competitive. | May not account for fluctuations in search demand or competition over time. |
| Can help you identify opportunities for long-tail keywords with lower competition. | May not consider the specific strengths and weaknesses of your website or industry. |
